# Sakila Database: Business Insights
Project demonstrates data-driven insights about the rental-patterns across films, customers, geographical locations etc.

The Sakila database is a nicely normalised schema modelling a DVD rental store, featuring things like films, actors, film-actor relationships, and a central inventory table that connects films, stores, and rentals. I connected Power BI to Sakila Database in My-SQL and analysed the data to understand the Rental patterns by geography, film-category, customers etc.

Analysis:

Rentals by Customer-Geography

Rentals by Film Category

The ER-Schema of the normalised Database, Power-BI file and a pdf showing the dashboard have been attached.
